    abstract: "This study explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence tools in vocational training centers across Delta State. Using a mixed-method approach, we analyzed student performance metrics before and after AI adoption. Results indicate a 15% increase in practical skill acquisition but highlight significant infrastructure gaps. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for state-level intervention.",
